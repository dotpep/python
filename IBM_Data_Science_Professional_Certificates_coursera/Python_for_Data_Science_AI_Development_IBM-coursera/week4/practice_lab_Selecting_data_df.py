Exercise 1: Pandas: DataFrame and Series
Pandas is a popular library for data analysis built on top of the Python programming language. Pandas generally provide two data structures for manipulating data, They are:

DataFrame
Series
A DataFrame is a two-dimensional data structure, i.e., data is aligned in a tabular fashion in rows and columns.

A Pandas DataFrame will be created by loading the datasets from existing storage.
Storage can be SQL Database, CSV file, an Excel file, etc.
It can also be created from the lists, dictionary, and from a list of dictionaries.
Series represents a one-dimensional array of indexed data. It has two main components :

An array of actual data.
An associated array of indexes or data labels.
The index is used to access individual data values. You can also get a column of a dataframe as a Series. You can think of a Pandas series as a 1-D dataframe.

"""
import pandas as pd


# DataFrame
# Define a dictionary 'x'
x = {'Name': ['Rose', 'John', 'Jane', 'Mary'], 'ID': [1, 2, 3, 4],
     'Department': ['Architect Group', 'Software Group', 'Design Team', 'Infrastructure'],
     'Salary': [100000, 80000, 50000, 60000]}

# casting the dictionary to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(x)

# display the result df
df

#Retrieving the "ID" column and assigning it to a variable x
x = df[['ID']]
x

#check the type of x
type(x)

#Retrieving the Department, Salary and ID columns and assigning it to a variable z
z = df[['Department','Salary','ID']]
z


# Exercise 1
# Problem 1: Create a dataframe to display the result as below:
data_dict = {"Student": ["David", "Samuel", "Terry", "Evan"],
            "Age": [27, 24, 22, 32],
            "Country": ["UK", "Canada", "China", "USA"],
            "Course": ["Python", "Data Structures", "Machine Learning", "Web Development"],
            "Marks": [85, 72, 89, 76]}
df1 = pd.DataFrame(data_dict)
df1

# Problem 2: Retrieve the Marks column and assign it to a variable b
b = df1[["Marks"]]
b

# Problem 3: Retrieve the Country and Course columns and assign it to a variable c
c = df1[["Country", "Course"]]
c


# Series
# To view the column as a series, just use one bracket:
x = df1['Student']
x

#check the type of x
type(x)

# The output shows us that the type of the variable is a Series object.


# Exercise 2
# loc() and iloc() functions
"""
loc() is a label-based data selecting method which means that we have to pass the name of the row or column that we want to select. This method includes the last element of the range passed in it.

Simple syntax for your understanding:

loc[row_label, column_label]
iloc() is an indexed-based selecting method which means that we have to pass integer index in the method to select a specific row/column. This method does not include the last element of the range passed in it.

Simple syntax for your understanding:

iloc[row_index, column_index]
"""
# loc() | label-based data selecting method - loc[row_label, column_label]
# Access the column using the name
df.loc[0, 'Salary']

# iloc() | indexed-based selecting method - iloc[row_index, column_index]
# Access the value on the first row and the first column
df.iloc[0, 0]

# Access the value on the first row and the third column
df.iloc[0,2]


# Let us create a new dataframe called 'df2' and assign 'df' to it.
# Now, let us set the "Name" column as an index column using the method set_index().
df2 = df
df2 = df2.set_index("Name")

# To display the first 5 rows of new dataframe
df2.head()

# Now, let us access the column using the name
df2.loc['Jane', 'Salary']

# Problem 1: Use the loc() function,to get the Department of Jane in the newly created dataframe df2.
df2.loc['Jane', 'Department']

# Problem 2: Use the iloc() function,to get the Salary of Mary in the newly created dataframe df2.
df2.iloc[3, 2]


# Exercise 3
# Slicing
"""
Slicing uses the [] operator to select a set of rows and/or columns from a DataFrame.

To slice out a set of rows, you use this syntax: data[start:stop],

here the start represents the index from where to consider, and stop represents the index one step BEYOND the row you want to select. You can perform slicing using both the index and the name of the column.

NOTE: When slicing in pandas, the start bound is included in the output.

So if you want to select rows 0, 1, and 2 your code would look like this: df.iloc[0:3].

It means you are telling Python to start at index 0 and select rows 0, 1, 2 up to but not including 3.

NOTE: Labels must be found in the DataFrame or you will get a KeyError.

Indexing by labels(i.e. using loc()) differs from indexing by integers (i.e. using iloc()). With loc(), both the start bound and the stop bound are inclusive. When using loc(), integers can be used, but the integers refer to the index label and not the position.

For example, using loc() and select 1:4 will get a different result than using iloc() to select rows 1:4.

We can also select a specific data value using a row and column location within the DataFrame and iloc indexing.

"""
# let us do the slicing using old dataframe df
df.iloc[0:2, 0:3]

#let us do the slicing using loc() function on old dataframe df where index column is having labels as 0,1,2
df.loc[0:2,'ID':'Department']

#let us do the slicing using loc() function on new dataframe df2 where index column is Name having labels: Rose, John and Jane
df2.loc['Rose':'Jane', 'ID':'Department']

# Problem 1: using loc() function, do slicing on old dataframe df to retrieve the Name, ID and department of index column having labels as 2,3
df.loc[2:3,'Name':'Department']
