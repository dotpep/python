## Databases and data

**Structured Query Language**

SQL relational database - for structured data (tables, records and relationships).
NoSQL - for unstructured data and massive amount of data.

---
Big Data - complex data that grows exponentially with time (highly unstructured or semi structured)
![[Pasted image 20231022210022.png|400]]
Cloud Databases

**Database types**

Flat files database - one-by-one: 
	(every line contains one record and fields, fixed lengths)
![[Pasted image 20231022210853.png|400]]
Hierarchical database - one-to-many relationship:
![[Pasted image 20231022210937.png|400]]
Network database - many-to many relationships:
	(In network database terminology, a child record is known as a member. A member or child can be reached through more than one parent, which is called an owner.)
![[Pasted image 20231022211200.png|400]]
Relational database (SQL) - Primary and foreign key, data stored in table, columns hold attributes, each record has a value for each attribute:
	(In a relational database system, data is stored in tables. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data. Each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships between data points. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID attribute called the primary key. A relational database stores and provides access to data that are related to one another using an attribute known as a foreign key.)
![[Pasted image 20231022211736.jpg|600]]
Object-oriented database - Instead of tables, there are entities or classes like Author, Book and Customer with their attributes and behaviors:
	(It’s possible to represent data according to OO concepts like inheritance and parent-child relationships among data. For example, an Author and Customer are both descendants of Person. Thus, a person is a generic entity that can represent both an Author and a Customer.)
![[Pasted image 20231022212016.png|600]]
No relational database (NoSQL) - unstructured data, for speed, flexibility in storing data, bigdata, key variable.
	(Data can be stored in an ad-hoc manner and they allow to store and process high volumes of different kinds of data. NoSQL databases are  capable of processing unstructured big data that’s generated by social media, IoT and others.)

## Intro to SQL

CRUD operations:
- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

Database Management System (DBMS)
![[Pasted image 20231022214527.png|400]]
As a web developer, you'll execute all SQL instructions on a database using a DBMS.

SQL is Standard language - Compatible with all available relational databases

#### SQL subsets:
- Data definition language (DDL)
- Data manipulation language (DML)
- Data query language (DQL)
- Data control language (DCL)

DDL:
- Create command - Used to create storage objects in a database, like tables.
- Alter command - Modify the structure of a table object in a database
- Drop command - Remove an existing object from a database
DML:
- (Populate, add and modify data to tables in a databases)
- Insert command - Insert records of data into a database table
- Update command - Edit data that already exists in a database table
- Delete command - Delete one or more rows of data from a table
DQL:
- Select command - (Read) Retrieve data from one or multiple tables letting you specify the data fields that you want based on preferred filter criteria.
DCL:
- (Control access to data stored in the database)
- Grant and Revoke - Give users access privileges to data, and to revert access privileges already given to users.

---
#### SQL syntax intro

DDL subsets of SQL:
1.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name; 
```
2.
```mysql
CREATE TABLE _table_name_ (  
    PersonID int PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    _column1 datatype_,  
    _column2 datatype_,  
    _column3 datatype_,  
   ....  
);
```
PRIMARY KEY - for relation to another table.
	The `PRIMARY KEY` constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values. A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).
AUTO_INCREMENT - Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.
[[database_notes#Data Types]]


if you add AUTO_INCREMENT you may do not specify ID in DML query.
DML:
3. add data to a table (without identifying columns if add values columns in creating tables)
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name  
VALUES (_value1_, _value2_, _value3_, ...);
```
3. add multiple data in one insert query (with identify columns)
```sql
```sql
INSERT INTO MyTable
  ( Column1, Column2, Column3 )
VALUES
  ('John', 123, 'Lloyds Office'), 
  ('Jane', 124, 'Lloyds Office'), 
  ('Billy', 125, 'London Office'),
  ('Miranda', 126, 'Bristol Office'),
  (_value1_, _value2_, _value3_, ...);
```
4. modify data
```sql
UPDATE _table_name_  
SET _column1_ = _value1_, _column2_ = _value2_, ...  
WHERE _condition_;
```
5. delete data from a table
```sql
DELETE FROM _table_name_ 
WHERE _condition_;
```

DQL:
6. Query data within a table (The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result-set.)
```sql
SELECT _column1_, _column2, ..._  
FROM _table_name_;
```
7. select all column
```sql
SELECT * FROM _table_name_;
```
8. clause is used to filter records
```sql
SELECT _column1_, _column2, ..._  
FROM _table_name_  
WHERE _condition_;
```

#### Common SQL Commands

##### Data Definition Language (DDL)
**CREATE Command**
Purpose: To create the database or tables inside the database
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name 
(
	column_name1 datatype(size), 
	column_name2 datatype(size), 
	column_name3 datatype(size)
 );
```
**DROP Command**
Purpose: To delete a database or a table inside the database.
```mysql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
**ALTER Command**
Purpose: To change the structure of the tables in the database such as changing the name of a table, adding a primary key to a table, or adding or deleting a column in a table.
1. Syntax to add a column into a table:
```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD (column_name datatype(size));
```
2. Syntax to add a primary key to a table:
```mysql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD primary key (column_name);
```
**TRUNCATE Command**
Purpose: To remove all records from a table, which will empty the table but not delete the table itself.
```mysql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```
**COMMENT Command**
```sql
--Retrieve all data from a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

##### Data Query Language (DQL)
**SELECT Command**
Purpose: To retrieve data from tables in the database.
```mysql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```

##### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
**INSERT Command**
Purpose: To add records of data into an existing table.
```mysql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
```
**UPDATE Command**
Purpose: To modify or update data contained within a table in the database.
```mysql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
**DELETE Command**
Purpose: To delete data from a table in the database.
```mysql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

##### Data Control Language (DCL)
You use DCL to deal with the rights and permissions of users of a database system. You can execute SQL commands to perform different types of operations such as create and drop tables. To do this, you need to have user rights set up. This is called user privileges. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in the database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

- `GRANT` Command to provide the user of the database with the privileges required to allow users to access and manipulate the database.
- `REVOKE` Command to remove permissions from any user.

##### Transaction Control Language (TCL)
The TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These are used to manage the changes made to the data in a table by utilizing the DML commands. It also allows SQL statements to be grouped together into logical transactions. This category deals with advanced functions or operations in a database. Note that this category can have a generic description of the two main commands. Use the following commands in this category:

- `COMMIT` Command to save all the work you have already done in the database. 
- `ROLLBACK` Command to restore a database to the last committed state.

- `ALTER TABLE` - modifies a table
- `DROP TABLE` - deletes a table
- `CREATE INDEX` - creates an index (search key)
- `DROP INDEX` - deletes an index



## Basic database structure

#### Tables
Columns - sometimes called fields or attributes.
Row - is known as a record (and tuple).

Data Types:
![[Pasted image 20231025223043.png|200]]
- Numeric data types such as INT, TINYINT, BIGINT, FLOAT, REAL. 
- Date and time data types such as DATE, TIME, DATETIME. 
- Character and string data types such as CHAR, VARCHAR. 
- Binary data types such as BINARY, VARBINARY. 
- Miscellaneous data types such as: 
	- Character Large Object (CLOB) for storing a large block of text in some form of text encoding.   
	- Binary Large Object (BLOB) for storing a collection of binary data such as images.

---
Domain - is the set of legal values that can be assigned to an attribute basically this means making sure that the values of field can hold are well defined.

Primary Key: (like unique id, used in relational table for relate other table with Foreign Key)
	- In a table, there is a field or column that is known as a key which can uniquely identify a particular tuple (row) in a relation (table). This key is specifically known as a primary key.
![[Pasted image 20231025223419.png|300]]
Foreign Key: 
	- Tables in a database do not stay isolated from each other. They need to have relationships between them. Tables are linked with one another through a key column (the primary key) of one table that’s also present in the related table as a foreign key. For example, the student table and the department table are linked via the student ID which is the primary key of the student table that’s also present in the Department table as a foreign key.
![[Pasted image 20231025224739.png|500]]

**Integrity constraints**
Every table in a database should abide by rules or constraints. These are known as integrity constraints.
There are three main integrity constraints:
1. Key constraints
	- In every table there should be one or more columns or fields that can be used to fetch data from tables. In other words, a primary key. The key constraint specifies that there should be a column, or columns, in a table that can be used to fetch data for any row.
2. Domain constraints
	- Domain constraints refer to the rules defined for the values that can be stored for a certain column. For instance, you cannot store the home address of a student in the first name column. Similarly, a contact number cannot exceed ten digits.
3. Referential integrity constraints
	- When a table is related to another table via a foreign key column, then the referenced column value must exist in the other table. This means, according to the student and department examples, that values should exist in the student ID column in the student table because the two tables are related via the student ID column.



#### Database Structure

Database structure refers to how data is arranged in a database. Within a database, related data are grouped into tables, each of which consists of rows (also called tuples) and columns, like in a spreadsheet.
The structure of a database consists of a set of key components. These include:
- Tables or entities, where the data is stored. 
- Attributes which are details about the table or entity. In other words, attributes describe the table.  
- Fields, which are columns used to capture attributes. 
- A record, which is one row of details about a table or entity. 
- And the primary key, which is a unique value for an entity.

**Logical database structure**
The logical structure of a database is represented using a diagram known as the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). It is a visual representation of how the database will be implemented into tables during physical database design, using a Database Management System (DBMS) like MySQL or Oracle, for example. 

A part of the logical database structure is how relationships are established between entities. These relationships are established between the instances of the entities. Accordingly, there can be three ways in which entity instances can be related to each other:

- One-to-one relationships 
- One-to-many relationships 
- Many-to-many relationships 

This is also known as cardinality of relationships. The logical database structure which is represented using an ERD also depicts these relationships.
Here’s an example of an ERD that has all these elements.
![[Pasted image 20231025230600.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231025231037.png]]


**Physical database structure**
Student and Department. 
The student table has a primary key of “Stud_id”, which is also present in the Department table as a foreign key. Therefore, the two tables are related to each other via the “Stud_id” field.
